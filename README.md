# Puzzle Fifteen: Graph Representation and Implementation

## Overview
# This project focuses on representing the Puzzle Fifteen game as a graph, exploring various implementations of graphs, 
# and providing a basic structure for the Puzzle Fifteen game itself.

## Puzzle Fifteen Game
# The Puzzle Fifteen game is represented as a graph with sixteen vertices:
# - Four corner vertices, each connected to only two other vertices.
# - Eight edge vertices, each connected to three other vertices.
# - Four central vertices, each connected to four other vertices.

## ADT Graph (graph.py)
# The `graph.py` module provides the ADT Graph with two classes:
# - `Vertex`: Represents a vertex in the graph.
# - `Graph`: Represents the graph itself.

# To check your graph implementation, run the driver code in the template file `graph.py` posted under `Files/Programming Assignments/PA5` on Canvas.

## ADT Fifteen (fifteen.py)
# The `fifteen.py` module provides the ADT Fifteen with the class `Fifteen`. 
# It offers the necessary structure for the Puzzle Fifteen game.

## Main Module (game.py)
# The `game.py` module serves as the main GUI program for the Puzzle Fifteen game. 
# Please note that the GUI implementation is not available in this project.

# Feel free to explore and enhance the code. To run the program, ensure you have implemented the graph structure correctly 
# and utilize the `game.py` module for the main graphical user interface of the Puzzle Fifteen game.
